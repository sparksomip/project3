Your goal is to maximize profits in solicitation 92-1 by planning and implement two rounds of mailings of up to 12 different product solicitations to up to 750,000 prospects. There are 750,000 people in a database; 250,000 in each of three BK groups (150, 200, and 250). You are invited to send, AT MOST, one solicitation to each of these people. Each solicitation will offer one and only one of the 12 available products, but you may send different solicitations (products) to different people. You may send your solicitations in two separate mailings (the first one will be called a test, and the second will be called a roll out). Or you may forego a test and simply send out a single roll-out mailing. As the case suggests, each mailing costs $800 (i.e. $800 for the test and $800 for the roll out). The first product solicitation you develop costs $10,000, and each additional product solicitation costs $1,000 to develop. Each solicitation costs $0.50 per piece to print and mail.
